    content: `Building my portfolio was something I put off for a long time, but I finally decided to just start. I wanted a site that felt modern, clean, and truly mine, so I chose React for its flexibility and Tailwind CSS for fast, beautiful styling.

I began by sketching a simple layout and listing the sections I wanted: About, Projects, Blog, and Contact. Using React made it easy to break everything into components, and Tailwind let me experiment with design without writing custom CSS for every detail.

One of my favorite parts was adding little touches—like smooth animations with Framer Motion and a GitHub activity feed. I also made sure the site works well on mobile and dark mode looks great.

The biggest lesson? Just start. Even if it's not perfect, you'll learn so much by building and iterating. Now, I&apos;m proud to have a portfolio that grows with me and shows who I am as a developer.`,
